## General Information

Notetaker was created with express.js to allow users to have one location for their notes online. When the user logs in, they will find an empty notepad to the left that when filled, generates the option to save the note to the note's array. The left hand side features a list of the previously recorded notes, each of which can be deleted when no longer relevant to the user.
